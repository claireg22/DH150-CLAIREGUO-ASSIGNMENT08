# Amazon Redesign
## Claire Guo

### Introduction
My project (redesigning Amazon) will support users in shopping for items they need or want easily without frustration or errors. Users will hopefully have quick and delightful online shopping experiences from the comfort of their own homes.
This activity fulfills human's physiological needs because users need to be able to have quick and easy access to items they need or want like clothes, essentials, or food in order to properly survive. In this activity, gaining access to these items is through purchasing them.

### Design statement: 
My user research project focuses on creating a quick, less frustrating, and more user-friendly online shopping experience for Amazon. While Amazon is a very well-known and widely-used website, there is large room for improvement for its user experience, especially in terms of accessibility, consistency, and functionality. The community of Amazon users is large, however, to accomodate users with less technological experience, Amazon needs a way to connect with their users quickly and directly. Through my user research and designs, I hope to make Amazon shopping experience faster, but still enjoyable for users, and make help on the website more accessible and personal. For this assignment I have created a high-fidelity prototype of my newly designed Amazon page.

### Competitor analysis: Heuristics
I decided to conduct a heuristic evaluation on Amazon because whenever I use Amazon to find products, I always find myself getting frustrated at very simple UX errors on the website - I never find the products I’m looking for, it is hard to find help, and I always catch myself almost clicking the wrong buttons on accident. Since Amazon is such a huge corporation, I believe its site needs better UX because it is how the company connects and communicates with its users. As a result, I was motivated to identify the specific UX faults on Amazon’s website using a heuristic evaluation.

### Competitor analysis: Usability Testing
The purpose behind user testing is to improve the design of a product for real users. User-tesing tests the usability of a product in order to make sure it is designed so that a real world user can accurately and fluently complete tasks or goals, enjoy using the product, and be willing to use it again. In other words, user testing is needed for successful user-centered design and to make products more useful because these test allow for user input on the designs through direct interaction with the product and it focuses the designs on the user and their realistic tasks. Usability tests put the product in a real-world scenerio before the product is released so that it can be improved to have a more satisfactory design, and bugs or frustrations can be caught early and fixed.

### User research:
I conducted user research for Amazon through participatory observation and found that the user prefers to buy certain items online vs. in person and the user enjoys "window-shopping" and looking at things they probably will not buy. Doing this does not make the task of purchasing items they need or want faster, but it enhances her experience.

### UX storytelling 
UX storytelling puts a human face on dry data and research and ensures that the improvements made in the product are user-centered. A good experience is like telling a good story - it places our product into a scenerio and allows us to visualize our product being used. From there, we will be able to understand why our product is used, how it can be used to resolve conflicts in our user's lives, and how users may feel when they use the product. UX storytelling requires developers to define the user and create stories around them and their goals. Developers are able to empathize with these personalized stories to better understand their user's emotional experiences as they use the product. In all, UX storytelling provides insight into potential users, allows for a simplified and personable method of presenting product information, and highlights the potential user scenerios applicable to the product.

### Low-fidelity prototype 
The purpose of my low-fidelity prototypes is to check and test the functionality of my new designs. It allows me to translate my high-level design concepts into physical and tangible entities that other people can interact with in order to identify flaws in functionality. My low-fidelity prototype is used to test how the features I proposed flow within a user's online shopping experience, and focuses on its practicality rather than visual appearance.

### High-fidelity prototype 
The purpose of a high-fidelity prototype is to make interactive designs and to study the functionality and usability of new design features. The high-fidelity prototype below is based on my low-fidelity prototpes, but now include more visual design information, such as graphic elements, colors, UI components, and familiar Amazon features. High-fidelity prototypes are interactive, validate the user interaction flow, and help find possible shortcomings to designs that need to be improved.
